视频推流与接收
======================================


**Yasea** is an Android streaming client. It is based on the source of both
[srs-sea](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-sea) and [SimpleRtmp](https://github.com/faucamp/SimpleRtmp).
It uses hard encoder for H.264/AAC and transmits over RTMP. Moreover, it runs
on Android mini API 16 (Android 4.1).
